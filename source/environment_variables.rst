Index of all Collection Environment Variables
=============================================

The following index documents all environment variables declared by plugins in collections.
Environment variables used by the ansible-core configuration are documented in `ansible_configuration_settings`_.

- `FLEXVM_ACCESS_USERNAME`: Your username. If you don't specify the username in the playbook, the program will try to read the username from here.
- `FLEXVM_ACCESS_PASSWORD`: Your password. If you don't specify the password in the playbook, the program will try to read the password from here.
